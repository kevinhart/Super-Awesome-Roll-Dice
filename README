Because of the system requirements for running both the frontend and backend (a server with PHP
libraries for the frontend proxy, machine with Java and superuser privileges for the backend, etc.)
we have set up a demo system on a CS-hosted machine.

The backend is hosted at: http://saskatoon.cs.rit.edu:4241/sards
The frontend is hosted at: http://saskatoon.cs.rit.edu:4242/sardstest

Other than experimenting with the backend directly, you will not need to access that backend
address. In fact, to successfully interact directly with the backend you must use a
well-formed query string. An invalid or incomplete query string causes undefined behaviour when
viewing directly from a browser.

To use the system, simply visit the frontend address listed above in a modern browser (has
been tested with the most recent versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome; support for other
browsers is unknown and cannot be guaranteed).
